/**
 * Configuration properties for managing states in the application.
 * <p>
 * This class maps properties from the application configuration with the prefix "state"
 * to fields in this class. It is used to hold configuration values related to various states
 * in the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following state-related properties are supported:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>cancel: Represents the state for cancellation.</li>
 *     <li>confirm: Represents the state for confirmation.</li>
 *     <li>complete: Represents the state for completion.</li>
 *     <li>neww: Represents the state for new entries.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is annotated with {@link Component} to be registered as a Spring Bean,
 * {@link ConfigurationProperties} to bind the properties with the "state" prefix,
 * and {@link Primary} to indicate that it is the primary bean of its type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The statuses that an order can receive during the business cycle are stored here.
 * In case something suddenly changes, you wonâ€™t have to lie down and change hard-coded statuses for all service classes
 * </p>
